                <p> I was born to a wealthy family that owns land in the southern part of England. But,
                then I was switched at birth with some nobody and it's been downhill ever since. </p>

               <p>I attended the University of Arizona where I was contemplating studying either Business
                or Computer Science. I ultimately chose Business because I thought
                that it would be the more useful degree<br> since it was generalized
                and I ended up graduating with a Bachelor's in Business Administration </p>

                    <p>Technically, I graduated from the Eller College of Business, but no one knows what I mean
                        when I say that.

                <p>Upon graduation I learned immediately that I had chosen wrong. I bounced from job to job where I <br>
                    quickly became a subject matter expert in each area, but never making enough money
                and or doing somnething I enjoyed. After getting a job with the help desk <br> for a software company I eventually
                decided that I wanted to go back to computer science, as that is where my passion lay</p>

                    I started learning to code in Java on my own after work. After I felt I learned a sufficient amount I
                    began looking into coding bootcamps to get more experience. And then, like a bolt out of the blue <br>
                    I was contacted by a company called Cognixia to sponsor me through the bootcamp and help me find a career afterwards.
